Summary
The Alphabet Lyric Checker is a programlet that checks whether words in supplied lyrics contain in order the full alphabet.

Inspiration
This game is an extension of the ever-popular car alphabet game; where players race competitively (or collaboratively) to find and call out letters from the alphabet (in order) in words seen on signs or license plates.

Rules
This version of the game takes that another step further by shifting the pool of words to those in the lyrics of the playing song. Generally this is done with one song, and each letter in it's own word (for example "Abe" would count for A, but not for B).
